The people of India have made the country world renowned with their active efforts.
Dynasties such as Chandragupta Mauraya, Ashoka etc.,are examples of ancient national unity.
There is a long list of iconic men financed fought against foreign armed attacks and rulers.
The bigger lie is the more effective.
Out of the 58 central schemes 16 have Rajiv Gandhi's name on them.
The names of such iconic men have been inspiring.
The public distribution system has already been brought into disrepute.
Who is stopping the Congress from asking for votes in the name of this scheme?
But what is the problem in looking beyond the Nehru family, when it comes to naming?
Patel is a great nation builder.
He joined 562 states into one nation.
Patel belongs to everyone, he is loved by the whole of India, but Congress has made him their own property.
The public distribution system may be named after Patel too.
This will not affect the importance of Patel in ko way.
Congress has been in power for a long time.
The politicisation of the schemes was done by Congress itself.
Party and Family have become synonymous.
To proclaim family and country synonymous the slogan 'Indira is India' was created.
The naming of the schemes has also become a household matter.
Government schemes are run from the accumulated exchequer, from the country's taxpayers.
The nation's exchequer is not the property of ko single family in Congress.

Everyone has icons, but the list of party icons kept increasing.
Currently, every ltsmallgt or large party has its own icon.
Government schemes are not run in the names of political leaders in America.

The laptops distributed in Uttar Pradesh have the picture of the SP chief on them.

The misuse of the exchequer is a constitutional offence.
Some kind of naming protocol has to be developed.
Political leaders are not the solution to everything.
India is full of multi-talented geniuses.
The names of the institutes of higher education / research institutions must named after talented Indian scientists.
There is a lack of a sense of history in politics.
There was also a long debate on naming the country in the constituent assembly.
Seth Govinddas, Kamalapati Tripathy put forward 'Bharat'.
The name Bharat received 38 votes and India received 51.
The funda question is: why is no serious thought given to the naming of the schemes?
Why is politics always involved in this?
Why is such importance given to one single family?
Why not make a list of ancestor public approved names?
Due to this negligence, the young generation is forgetting the names of our freedom fighters.
There are different Trigger of heroes.
Some are created by TV and mostly are biased with political prejudice.
